	<h3>Shopping list</h3>
	<p>See <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LKn-T8sHbHuLjJCwfLy01gtQOaFFOJlrdSAhJvjgnYI/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets</a> for some ideas about expenses</p>

	<h3>Priorities</h3>
	<p>Concrete floor.</p>

	<p>Sewage system. It's not a problem until it becomes a problem. We are enviromentally aware and we want to treat our sewage properly.</p>

	<h3>Scope, timeline, budget</h3>
	<p>Replace the current mixed wooden floor with a concrete one to modern specifications. Build accommodation for a crew of 10. Install a kitchen, additional shower, toilet and an outdoor hot tub. Create breakout spaces and install heating and lighting. We want to create a space that inspires, we will work with set designers to create a ship within the budget possibly mixing traditional woodenship architecture with something a bit more space ship. By using advanced manufacturing methods such as laser cutting we think we can create intricate and precision made furniture in this vein at low cost. </p>

	<p>We won’t be able to create the ultimate luxury in our first iteration, but an outdoor hot tub, mini gym and a space play some music are definitely achievable.</p>

	<p>We’ll achieve this iteratively and start with a simple ship for a working crew of around 10.</p>

	<h3>Shopping list</h3>
	<p>See <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LKn-T8sHbHuLjJCwfLy01gtQOaFFOJlrdSAhJvjgnYI/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets</a> for some ideas about expenses</p>

	<h3>Priorities</h3>

	<p>Concrete floor. No matter what we decide to build in the future, the proper floor will provide proper foundation and insulation.</p>

	<p>Sewage system. It's not a problem until it becomes a problem. We are enviromentally aware and we want to treat our sewage properly.</p>

	<h3>Scope, timeline, budget</h3>
	<p>Replace the current mixed wooden floor with a concrete one to modern specifications. Build accommodation for a crew of 10. Install a kitchen, additional shower, toilet and an outdoor hot tub. Create breakout spaces and install heating and lighting. We want to create a space that inspires, we will work with set designers to create a ship within the budget possibly mixing traditional woodenship architecture with something a bit more space ship. By using advanced manufacturing methods such as laser cutting we think we can create intricate and precision made furniture in this vein at low cost. </p>

	<p>We won’t be able to create the ultimate luxury in our first iteration, but an outdoor hot tub, mini gym and a space play some music are definitely achievable.</p>

	<p>We’ll achieve this iteratively and start with a simple ship for a working crew of around 10.</p>

	<h3>Chapel and the vestry</h3>
	<p>Vestry - building attached to the chapel - here we have much more creative freedom. Because some of us have little kids we would like to refurbish it to the "child friendly" standard. No contraptions, safety hazard, any other healh risks. In the times when kids are not around we would rent the space on AirBnb or booking.com to provide extra income.</p>

	<p>Chapel is a listed building frmo 1838 - there are some restrictions in place. Also the space is much larger - it's more expensive to ensure proper standard. That is why we develop space iteratively and focus on priorities first.</p>

	<p>We intend to keep the open space <strong>open and reconfigurable</strong>. In that way we will accomodate for all sorts of events, parties, functions, trainings, retreats. We will also work with local planner to ensure we follow the letter of law.</p>

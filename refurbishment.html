	<h3>Chapel and the Vestry</h3>

	<p><strong>April update: </strong> we are currently focusing on developing vestry. We love to have input from Architect and Engineers who'd like to help us. Please get in touch and we'll add you to our Slack channel. We're particulalry interested in using Environmentally friends material while creating very good insulation as Welsh winters can be cold..</p>

	<p>Vestry - building attached to the chapel - We're rennovating this into a living space for the core team. While seperate to the Chapel (the ship) the Vestry fits along side. We will refurbish it as a warm, homely 'child friendly' to a high standard standard. We want a space that when we're no using we can rent out on AirBnb or booking.com to provide extra income.</p>

	<p>Chapel is a listed building from 1838 - there are some restrictions in place. The current planning permission and listed building concent allow us to remove the pew and create a 2 story home while retaining the current wooden gallery. We will work with visionary architects to create and amazing space that brings out the best of the historic features and create a hyper-modern ship like interior for inspiring innovation. We will need significant funds to fully rennovate this space and so we anticipate approaching it in stages.</p>

	<p>We intend to keep the main space as <strong>open and reconfigurable</strong> as possible. In that way we will be able to accomodate all sorts of events, parties, functions, trainings, retreats etc. We will work with local planners to ensure we follow the letter of law and create a space that is safe and accessible for all it's users</p>


	<h3>Shopping list</h3>
	<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">See <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LKn-T8sHbHuLjJCwfLy01gtQOaFFOJlrdSAhJvjgnYI/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets</a> for some ideas about expenses</p>

	<h3>Scope, timeline, budget</h3>
	<p>Replace the current mixed wooden floor with one build to modern specifications. Build accommodation for a crew of 10. Install a kitchen, additional shower, toilet and an outdoor hot tub. Create breakout spaces and install heating and lighting. We want to create a space that inspires, we will work with set designers to create a ship within our budget, possibly mixing traditional woodenship architecture with something a bit more space shippy. By using advanced manufacturing methods such as laser cutting we think we can create intricate and precision made furniture in this vein at low cost. </p>

	<p>We won’t be able to create the ultimate luxury in our first iteration, but an outdoor hot tub, mini gym and a space play some music are definitely achievable.</p>

	<p>We’ll achieve this iteratively and start with a simple ship for a working crew of around 10.</p>

	<h3>Tasks, jobs, collaboration</h3>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I highly advise to get a professional building manager to assess your plans in the beginning. It usually saves HUGE amount of resources if there is not professionals or very experienced builders around.</p>

		<p>Doing things right is less expensive than doing things fast and having to repair for years.</p>

		<p>I am all about self reliance but I also come from a family of carpenders (mother, her brother and more), I researched and interviewed people that build their own buildings. ALL said that having an specialist give advise and teach in the beginning either saved them a lot or would have saved a lot.</p>

	<h3>Planning permission</h3>
	<blockquote>
		How are laws about old historical/old buildings? Are you allowed to fix it and change as you see fit?

	<h3>Is it for real?</h3>
	<p>We own the chapel. Chapel is in place.</p>
	<p>It has massive potential waiting to be realised. We need to enhance the infrastructure to accomodate more people and sail on the projects...</p>

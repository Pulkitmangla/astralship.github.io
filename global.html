	<h3>Replicate the model / Operating at scale</h3>

	<h3>Our unique edge</h3>
	<p>There is a number of reasons why believe the project is going to be successful. We own the place, we have planning permission and we are vital parts of various online communities. We believe that work that we do in Snowdonia will be used in other places around the globe.</p>

	<p>At this stage we are planning <a href="investment.html">crowdfunding campaign</a> that is achievable and realistic. Once we prove that everything works as expected we will be ready for much larger investments to acquire real-estate in other worldwide and European locations <em>(London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona)</em> - international hubs with access to creative talent.</p>

	<p>First ship in Snowdonia is to demonstrate that is not only economically sustainable but also a facilitates the highest degrees of human creativity, collaboration and productivity - see <a href="flow.html">flow states</a>. Once we've proved this we'll build other ships in exceptional locations around the world. We believe it's quite possible for a talent young creatives and developers to be able to travel and work on voyages without ever needing to take up a year in year out 9-5 conventional job to fund their way.</p>

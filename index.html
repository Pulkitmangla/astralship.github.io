								<h2>Setting the dreamers free</h2>
								<p>What drove ancient sailors beyond the horizons in search of new lands? Viking or pirates, when times were tough they took matters into their own hands. We're going to follow their lead.</p>
								<p>The Astralship will provide everything a creative team needs to acheive peak performance. Inspiring spaces to sleep, focus, build, co-design, create and relax. When the elements of a project are aligned and brought together in the right environment and with the right faciliation, the results can be a 1000x. </p>

								<h2>Collaboration and Innovation.</h2>
								<p>We're building a facility where developers, designers, engineers, radical thinkers and all creatives can work together at <a href="flow.html">peak performance</a>. Channeling passion and creating world-changing innovation through short focussed projects we call voyages. </p>

								<h2>A inspiring and exciting space</h2>
								<p>In the Chapel there is plenty of room to work with. We've already build a prototype ship and found to be a very inspiring space though it's quite rough around the edges at the moment. We'll create high-quality living working and recreational spaces. Innovation is an adventure. We'll create a magical and inspiring interior which will suggest adventure on even the most serious of voyages.</p>

								<h2>Stunning Natural Location</h2>
								<p>The Chapel stands on the slopes of Elidir across the valley from Snowdon <i>(the highest mountain in England and Wales)</i>. It's just a few hundred metres from the boundary of Snowdonia national park. When tackling a hard problem, sometimes the best thing a team can do is take a break get some altitude. Snowdonia, and it‚Äôs breathtaking scenery of mountains and beaches is literally on the doorstep. After a hike in the middle of a challenging voyage, there will be an Japanese onsen style hot-tub to unwind in before the nexts days work begins.</p>

								<h2>Let's go sailing</h2>
								<p>For now we are gathering interest in the project and looking for those who want to come on a journey with us.</p>
								<p>We are plannig to launch the Kickstarter campaign to get additional funds, gather the momentum and conduct real-life market research. See our <a href="investment.html">investment</a> proposal.</p>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>Building the ship</h3>
									<p>We need an new floor, insulation, ligtning, a wood fired heating system and a beautiful interior. We estimate we need around <strong>¬£50,000</strong> to do a good job of all of this, though we could happily spend ¬£200,000+ if we had the budget. The money will come from our savings, family and friends, and crowding funding. We're developing this plan now but are looking architect, artists psychologists and builders who want to be involved. </p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Sharing the wealth created</h3>
									<p>In the convential paradigm, getting a team together to work on ideas is expensive and time consuming. The big money investors decide on the projects and keep the rewards. By providing a ship which is able to sustain teams at low cost we'll be able reach prototype stage very quickly, minimising the cost and time the founders need to invest. </p>
									<p>As time goes on we'll increasingly build resources to help teams leverage the results of their voyages and hope some team will return to our ships for subsequent voyages as they carry on their mission.</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Early days</h3>
									<p>While we gather the funds to make a major rennovation of our ship, we will engage in mini-projects such as website, crowdfunding video, the architectural and interior design of the ship. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16TrGsvvNLCZ88LO-GDEdip8s-WpNv3Cr5EjHrC-f24o/edit">Google Doc</a> with the outline of the competition. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>For profit and not for profit</h3>
									<p>We are setting up a Social enterprise Company in the U.K. We will use some or all our profits to fund technology and education, specifically technologies that can be used to achieve sustainability. 
								</li>
								
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>An open invitation to sail together</h3>
									<p>We have big dreams and with your help we'll achieve them. If you like our vision please share this site to help us find others who might want to be involved. If you'd like to get involved and help shape and develop any aspect of this project and our crowdfunding campaign, please get in touch.</p>

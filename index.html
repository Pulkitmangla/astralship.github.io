								<h2>What is an Astralship?</h2>
								<p>What drove ancient sailors beyond the horizons in search of new lands? Viking or pirates, when times were tough they took matters into their own hands. We're going to follow their lead.</p>
								<p>The Astralship will provide everything a creative team needs to acheive peak performance. Inspiring spaces to focus, build, co-design, create, relax and sleep. When elements of a project are aligned and brought together in the right environment and with the right faciliation, creativity and productivity explode. </p>

								<h2>Collaboration and Innovation.</h2>
								<p>We're building a facility where developers, designers, engineers, radical thinkers and all creative beings can work together at <a href="flow.html">peak performance</a>. Where we can channel passion and facilitate collaboration and productivity, creating world-changing innovation through short & focused projects which we call voyages.</p>

								<h2>A inspiring and exciting space</h2>
								<p>In the Chapel there is plenty of room to work with. We've build a prototype ship and found it to be an inspirational space. </p>
								<p>Innovation is an adventure. We'll create a magical and inspiring interior with high-quality living, working and recreational spaces that suggest adventure on even the most serious and focussed of voyages.</p>

								<h2>Stunning Natural Location</h2>
								<p>The Chapel stands on the slopes of Elidir across the valley from Snowdon <i>(the highest mountain in England and Wales)</i> a few hundred metres from the national park. </p>
								<p>When tackling a hard problem, sometimes the best thing to do is take a break and get some altitude. Snowdonia, and it‚Äôs breathtaking scenery of mountains and beaches is literally on the doorstep. </p>
								<p>After a hike in the middle of a challenging voyage, there will be an Japanese onsen style hot-tub to unwind in, and a hearty meal before the nexts days work begins.</p>

								<h2>Let's go sailing</h2>
								<p>For now we are gathering interest in the project and looking for those who want to come on a journey with us.</p>
								<p>We are planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign to get additional funds, gather momentum and gauge interest in our project. See our <a href="investment.html">investment</a> proposal.</p>
							</header>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>Building the ship</h3>
									<p>At minimum need a new floor, insulation, ligtning, a wood fired heating system and a beautiful interior. We estimate we need around <strong>¬£50,000</strong> to retrofit our prototype. We'll architect things in such away that we can continue to build on an enhance the space in future. The money will come from our savings, family and friends, and crowding funding. We're developing this plan now and are looking architects, artists, psychologists, builders and creators of all kinds who want to be involved. </p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Sharing the wealth created</h3>
									<p>In the convential paradigm, getting a team together to work on ideas is expensive and time consuming. The big money investors decide on the projects and keep the rewards. By providing a ship which is able to sustain teams at low cost teams can reach prototype stage with optimal efficiency, minimising the time <italic>(and funds)</italic>the founders need to reach fruition. </p>
									<p>As time goes on we'll increasingly develop resources that aid teams in leveraging the results of their voyages. Teams are welcome to return to our ships for subsequent voyages as we carry on our missions</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Early days</h3>
									<p>While we gather the funds to make a major rennovation of our ship, we will engage in mini-projects such as website, crowdfunding video, the architectural and interior design of the ship.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>For profit and not for profit</h3>
									<p>We are setting up a Social enterprise Company in the U.K. We will use some or all our profits to fund technology and education, specifically technologies that can be used to achieve sustainability.</p>

								<h2>Setting the dreamers free</h2>
								<p>What drove ancient sailors beyond the horizons in search of new lands? Viking or pirates, when times were tough they took matters into their own hands. We're going to follow their lead.
								Many talented creatives are locked into soulless corporate jobs, looking for something meaningful. The old paradigm, get a job, a mortgage, kids and wait for retirement doesn't wash while this world is burning. 
								<p>The Astralship will provide everything a creative team needs to acheive peak performance. Inspiring spaces to sleep, focus, build, co-design, create and relax. Fully enabled, small teams can do amazing things.

								<h2>Collaboration and Innovation.</h2>
								<p>We're building a facility where developers, designers, engineers, radical thinkers and all creatives can work together at peak performance. Channeling passion and creating world changing innovation through short focussed projects we call voyages. Some voyages will be fully controlled by those commissioning the ship, others we will lead and curate ourselves. We will recruit crews according to the needs of the voyage and facilitate them to achieve the best performance. </p>

								<h2>A inpsiring and exciting space</h2>
								<p>In the Chapel where we will build the ship there is plenty of room to work with. We've already build a prototype ship and found to be a very inspiring space though it's quite rough around the edges at the moment. Ultimately we want to create high-quality living, working and recreational space for a crew of up to 24. We want a space that facilitates effective collaboration and states of flow. Art and architecuture is very important to our vision. We will use laser cutting and CNC routing techniques amongst others to create an incredible and magical ship interior using a fusion of styles. Think wooden pirate ship meets space ship meets Japanese ryokan meets ambient indoor druid forest moss garden. Crew on duty should be able to push themselves to the limits of their abilities, but when it’s time for a break the ship should provide fine cuisine sourced from local organic farms and allow the crew to unwind effectively ready for the next day. </p>

								<h2>Stunning Natural Location</h2>
								<p>The Chapel stands on the slopes of Elidir acorss the valley from Snowdon (the highest mountain in England and Wales). It's just a few hundred metres from the boundary of Snowdonia national park. When tackling a hard problem, sometime the best thing a team can do is take a break get some altitude. Snowdonia, and it’s breathtaking scenery of mountains and beaches is literally on the doorstep. After a hike in the middle of a challenging voyage, there will be an Japanese onsen style hot-tub to unwind in before the nexts days work begins</p>

								<h2>Connection with the World</h2>
								<p>While the location is physically very remote (although only 3hrs on the train from London), we don't have problems of connectivity. In 2017 we expect to get fibre to the premises installed as part of the Superfast Wales programme. In the meantime we can already get >60Mbps via 4G connection. Teams will be able to get away from all physical distractions but still have access to any information they need to solve challenges or interact with the world at large.</p>

								<h2>Let's go sailing</h2>
								<p>For now we are gathering interest in this project and looking for those who want to come on a journey with us</p>
								
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>Building the ship</h3>
									<p>We need an new floor, insulation, ligtning, a wood fired heating system and a beautiful interior. We estimate we need to about £50,000 to do a good job of all of this. The money will come from our savings, family and friends, and crowding funding. We're developing this plan now but are looking architect, artists and builder who want to be involved.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>Peak Performance</h3>
									<p>Proper sleep, food, exercise and essential. Some people say <em>life-work balance</em>, we prefer <em>life-work integration</em>. We will build an environment that enables and inspires the best teams to produce the best work. We will consult experts in cognitive psychology and bring them together with architects on our current prototype ship to design the next iteration</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-headphones">
									<h3>The voyages</h3>
									<p>Once we have a ship we have many ideas for voyages we want to make. Humans have to change the way they are living on this planet and soon if we are to be around much longer. Our team won't control all the voyages, sometimes we'll sail ourselves, sometimes we'll plan voyages and recruits crew, and other times we'll simply hand over the ship for others to use. When we set the goals we'll seek to tackle some of the grand societal challenges facing us today. Think <a href="http://www.poc21.cc/">http://www.poc21.cc/</a> but on an ongoing basis. Voyages are suited to rapid prototyping of ideas and tackling innovation and design challenges. Sometime it could be an entrepreneur with funding wanting to develop their business idea and take it to market faster than any corporate environment will allow, where we make money like this we'll use it to offset the cost of other voyages which may have great social benefit but not their own funding</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>A global fleet</h3>
									<p>Our vision to build a ship in Snowdonia and demonstrate it is not only economically sustainable but also a facilitates the highest degrees of human creativity, collaboration and productivity. Once we've proved this we'll build other ships, or alternatively themed environments, in other amazing locations around the world. We believe it's quite possible for a talent young creatives and developers to be able to travel and work on voyages around the world without ever needing to take up a year in year out 9-5 conventional job to fund their way. In way it's harking back to the sea faring days of old. Actually, our dream is for crews who love sailing to be able to physically sail between these locations.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Sharing the wealth created</h3>
									<p>In the convential paradigm, getting a team together to work on ideas is very expensive and it tend to be the big money investors that decide the projects and keep the rewards. By providing a ship which is able to sustain teams at low cost we'll allow starts to form and accelerate development and reach prototype stage very quickly, minimising the cost and time the founders need to invest. </p>
									<p>As time goes on we'll increasingly build resources to help teams leverage the results of their voyages and hope some team will return to our ships for subsequent voyages as they carry on their mission.</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>The pre-voyages</h3>
									<p>While we gather the funds to make a major rennovation of our ship, we will fund some short pre-voyages with what we currently have to help inform and design the ship we will build. Specifically we will voyage for our website and crowdfunding video, the architectural and interior design of the ship and a voyage for visionary artists.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Not for profit</h3>
									<p>We are setting up a not for profit Community Interest Company in the U.K. We will use our profits to fund technology education, specifically technologies that can be used to achieve sustainability.</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>An open invitation to sail together</h3>
									<p>We have big dreams and with your help we'll achieve them. If you like our vision please share this site to help us find others who might want to be involved. If you'd like to get involved and help shape and develop any aspect of this project and our crowdfunding campaign, please get in touch. </p>

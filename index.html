								<h2>What is Astralship?</h2>
								<p>Astralship is a project to create a visionary facility for <strong>Creativity</strong>, <strong>Innovation</strong> and <strong>Collaboration</strong>.</p>

								<p>We are leveraging state of the art developments in fields from Architecture and IoT, to Psychology and advanced manufacturing to repurpose an old Chapel in Snowdonia</p>

								<p>The new space will enable teams reaching their <strong>full potential</strong> and change the world.</p>

								<h2>Pirate ships and Innovation</h2>
								<p>We are building a facility where developers, designers, engineers and radical thinkers work together in <a href="flow.html">flow states</a> uninterrupted by the outside world. Steve Jobs said it's better to be a Pirate than join the navy. He was right, and we like naval metaphors so expect many references to pirates, sailing, voyages, journeying and hard working crew conquering new lands.</p>

								<p>Changemakers don't accept the status quo, they go out and make it happen. The ship provides everything a crew needs to go on innovation journeys. An optimal physical and psychological space - proper sleep, nutrition and exercise - to channel passion, tackle the hard problems and change the world.</p>

								<h2>Total Immersion</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>No barriers: All immediate physical and psychological needs of the crew met</li>
									<li>No distractions: An inspiring and self contained world to sustain and shelter the crew from the everyday world

									<li>Space and support: Space to decompress, relax and hike when the energies get too high</li>

								<h2>A inspiring and exciting space</h2>
								<p>In the Chapel there is plenty of room to work with. We've already built a prototype ship and found it to be an inspirational space. Now we're upgrading and sharing with the world.</p>
								<p>We are creating magical and inspiring interior with high-quality living, working and recreational spaces that suggest adventure on even the most serious and focussed of voyages.</p>

								<h2>The <a href="voyages.html">Voyages</a></h2>
								<p>We are building a ship, but once built where will we sail? We have a number of revenue models; sometimes we'll assemble specialist crews to tackle our innovation challenges, sometimes we'll lease it out entirely. The ship will allow the bravest and brightest to push themselves and expand their limits.</p>\\
								<p>Some voyages will be very intense, lasting up to 2 weeks, and some crews will need specialist facilitation to reach their goals. On a voyage, start-up teams will design and prototype new products or services, work that might have taken many months under traditional conditions.</p>

								<h2>Stunning Natural Location</h2>
								<p>The Chapel stands on the slopes of Elidir across the valley from Snowdon <i>(the highest mountain in England and Wales)</i> a few hundred metres from the Snpwdonia National Park. </p>
								<p>When tackling a hard problem, sometimes the best approach is take a break and get some altitude. Snowdonia - and it’s breathtaking scenery of mountains and beaches - is literally on the doorstep. </p>
								<p>After a hike in the middle of a challenging voyage, there will be a Japanese onsen style hot-tub to unwind in, and a hearty meal before the nexts day's work begins.</p>

								<h2>Let's go sailing</h2>
								<p>For now we are gathering interest in the project and looking for those who want to come on a journey with us.</p>
								<p>We are planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign to get additional funds, gather momentum and gauge interest in our project. See our <a href="investment.html">investment</a> proposal.</p>
								<p>In preparation for the crowdfunding we campaign we are organising &quot;building party&quot; to showcase what is possible... Get your tickets on <a href="https://astralship.eventbrite.co.uk">Eventbrite</a>.

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>Building the ship</h3>
									<p>At minimum we need a new floor, insulation, lightning, a heating system and a inspiring interior (sorry this is essential). We estimate we need around <strong>£50,000</strong> to retrofit our prototype. We'll architect things in such a way that we can continue to build on and enhance the space in future. The money will come from our savings, family and friends and crowdfunding. We're developing this plan now and are looking for architects, artists, psychologists, carpenters, builders and creators of all kinds who want to be involved. </p>

								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Sharing the wealth created</h3>
									<p>In the convential paradigm, getting a team together to work on ideas is expensive and time consuming. The big money investors decide on the projects and keep the rewards. By providing a ship which is able to sustain teams at low cost, teams can reach prototype stage with optimal efficiency, minimising the time <italic>(and funds)</italic> the founders need to spend to reach fruition. </p>
									<p>As time goes on we'll increasingly develop resources that aid teams in leveraging the results of their voyages. Teams are welcome to return to our ships for subsequent voyages as we carry on our missions</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Early days</h3>
									<p>While we gather the funds to make a major rennovation of our ship, we will engage in mini-projects such as developing our website, a crowdfunding video and the architectural and interior design of the ship. We are creating 3D model of what the ship will look like in the future.</p>

								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>A social enterprise</h3>
									<p>We intend to set up as a Community Interest Company in the U.K. We will use our profits to fund technology education where they are most needed, starting with our local community in North Wales. Specifically we want to enable local people to develop technology skills that will support the local economy in the future, create a local culture of innovation and support environmental sustainability.</p>

									<h3>Equinox Gathering March 2017</h3>
									<p>We are inviting everyone interested in working with us to join us onboard in March 2017. We want to clean up the chapel and make it ready for filming our crowdfunding video. We're inviting all artists, makers and creators, anyone with skills or just enthusiasm who want to come and help us. Drop in at any point and stay as long as you want. March 25th, at the end of 3 weeks we'll have a party to celebrate our project launch.

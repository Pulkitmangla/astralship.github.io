	<h3>We create space to enable collaboration and innovation.</h3>

	<p>We believe that living and working in such an environment will foster innovation on unprecedented levels of prouctivity.</p>

	<p>Proper sleep, food, exercise and essential. Some people say <em>life-work balance</em>, we prefer <em>life-work integration</em>. We will build an environment that enables and inspires the best teams to produce the best work. We are consulting with cross-disciplinary experts to out prototype ship to design the next iteration.</p>

	<p>Crew on duty should be able to push themselves to the limits of their abilities, but when itâ€™s time for a break the ship should provide fine cuisine sourced from local organic farms and allow the crew to unwind effectively ready for the next day.</p>
	
	<h3>Food, nutrition, exercise, physical activity</h3>

	<p>I think I'll start from building standing desk... Sitting is the new smoking. Seriously... Human body is not designed to sit for extended period of times. No worries, we will ensure a lot of physical activity to provide wellbeing to our crew.</p>


	<h3>Old system: engagement at work</h3>
	<p>Refer to some data. More often than not employees are disengaged in their work. Only a lucky few can truly tell <strong>I love my work</strong>.</p>

	<p>Higher education is expensive and some young people to decide to take a student loan. When leaving university they are enslaved in debt and in order to meet their financial obligations often engage employment that server merely to <strong>pay the bills</strong>.</p>

	<p>Real life example - commute to work. Been there done that - driving to the station - boarding a train to London - then cycling to the office. 1h30m journey... Not complaining - observing the reality and energy on the commuters train - by the time I've arrived to the office I was already tired.</p>

	<p>Now imagine - exceptional environment with proper lightning, oxygen, plants and different sections: food, sleep, relax, exercise...</p>


	<h3>Meditation sleep hack</h3>
	<p>Set the intention before going to sleep. Let the subconscious do the hard work.</p>

	<h3>Meal hack</h3>
	<p>We prefer solid meals. So that we are not hungry immediately afterwards. Using spices to add extra flavour and keep us warm. Depending on the weather outside...</p>

	<h3>Sun hack</h3>
	<p>It's often rainy and foggy, so whenever there is Sun outside it's almost obligatory to get your dose of vitamin D.</p>

	<h3>New models of ownership and governance</h3>
	<p>In order to open a bank account and operate smoothly within the legal framework we will register as ____. We are still working on that part so if you have any experience in legal and accountating matters please see our <a href="jobs">jobs page</a></p>

	<p>We want to offer small portions of equity to all the investors, supporters and crew members. We will work with you to establish the outcome that is mutually beneficial. We believe that being invested in the company and actually owning the piece of it <em>(participating in the upside potential)</em> is the best way to stay motivated and be there for the long haul.</p>

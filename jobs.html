<p>We value our workers a lot and we decided to introduce our &quot;minimal wage&quot; equal to at least 150% of the minimal wage enforced by the government. At the same time - for certain type of jobs we cannot compete with corporate rates - that is why we are proposing <strong>equity grants</strong>, see existing proposal on <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/genesis.re/document/d/1A03W2KHrGQvoU1AELQbG63J4myAEaNVag0w0SGuyx_o/edit?usp=drive_web">Google Docs</a>.</p>

<p>It may happen that responsibilities are overlaping - it's expected - we are multidisciplinary near and we operate in fully agile matter, based on meritocraty - right person for the right job.

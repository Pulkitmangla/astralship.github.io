	<h3>Holding company</h3>
	<p>We intend that the "chapel" <em>(holding company that owns the chapel)</em> will own a portion of equity of each spin-off company - this is to incentivise investors and ensure long-term prosperity of the project.</p>
	

	<h3>Kickstarter </h3>
	<p>We will use a crowdfunding platform. The intention is to obtain extra funding, to conduct real-life <strong>market research</strong> and make waves in the cyberspace. It is also one of the first <a href="journeys.html">voyages</a> for us...</p>

	<p><strong>We are still working on the video and exact reward structure.</strong> In the meanwhile we are offering super-earliest-bird rewards. The intention is to make use of the traffic and interest even before the Kickstarter is live. The funding collected at this stage will be converted to rewards at 20% discount - this is to incentivise early commitment and take into consideration lack of the platform fees.</p>

	<p><em>(we believe Kickstarter is the best platform because a lot of people have already payment details on file)</em></p>

	<p>Here are some rewards we were considering at the moment:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>£1 postcard <em>(to get plenty of backers and boost visibility)</em></li>
		<li>Do we want such small reward? <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-1-Kickstarter-reward">https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-1-Kickstarter-reward</a></li>
		<li>£5 meal</li>
		<li>£25 one night stay</li>
		<li>£100 one hour digital strategy session</li>
		<li>£500 day of engineering work (consultancy)</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Much longer hospitality packages <em>(weeks, months, years)</em></li>
		<li>Hire they chapel for a journey...</li>
		<li>Hire the crew a journey...</li>
	</ul>
	We are considering hiring our resources both in terms of the venue and manpower. See more about <a href="voyages.html">voyages</a>.


	Some random ideas thrown into space to see what sticks:
	<ul>
		<li>Memorable plaque</li>
		<li>Privilege to name each of the pillars supporting the upper gallery</li>
		<li>Design your own stained glass</li>
		<li>Sales of artworks created by supporting artists</li>
		<li>Perpetual memberships</li>
		<li>"build your own room"</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Borrowing</h3>
	<p>We are evaluating option of obtaining a mortgage.</p>

	<h3>Own cash</h3>
	<p>I have savings, you have savings, we can probably find a few invested individuals too.</p>

	<h3>Sustainable business(es)</h3>
	<p>Once we have a Astralship we will release plenty of energy to create a number of products, websites, apps, prototypes, proof-of-concepts. Some of them will be spin-off and will generate income that will be reinvested. Because of our unique structure we believe majority of the projects will be related to the new models of governance and ownership.</p>

	<h3>Hospitality</h3>
	<p>Go to place for digital nomads, makers, researchers to work with likeminded individuals. See <a href="flow.html">flow state</a> to see benefits of working from the chapel</p>

	<h3>Company sponsorship</h3>
	<p>TODO: company pays a certain amount and in exchange we offer days in the chappel and other related services.</p>

	<h3>Retreats</h3>
	<p>Chapel is a spacious venue and could host a whole company of up to 24 people. It could be eligible to rent for a specified number of days.</p>

	<h3>Equity crowdfunding</h3>
	<p>SEIS, <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/">https://www.seedrs.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/">https://www.crowdcube.com/</a> - open to such options... If you are an accountant, lawyer or any person skilled in navigating paperwork - please join us. We would much rather avoid costly mistakes on silly technicalities. We need you.</p>

	<h3>Council, Government, EU, Lottery Fund</h3>
	<p>They are rather slow to move and require a lot of paperwork. We may want to lay foundation ourselves, prove feasability and apply for larger grants later on. At this stage we prefer to run it the independently using own cash and money coming from crowdfunding.</p>

	<h3>Visionaires, Philanthropists</h3>
	<p>Not the typical investors expecting 100x returns, obsessed about the bottom line. We are looking for individuals who believe in the mission and want support the project and want to participate in the adventure.</p>

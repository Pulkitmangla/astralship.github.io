title: Investment and making money

	<h2>Here are some initial ideas</h2>
	We are costanstaly working on this section. We intend that the "chapel" <em>(company that owns chapel)</em> will own a small percentage of each spin-off company - this is to incentivise investors and ensure long-term prosperity of the project.

	<hr/>

	<h3>Own cash</h3>
	<p>I have savings, you have savings, we can probably find a few invested individuals too.</p>

	<h3>Sustainable business(es)</h3>
	<p>We will create a number of products, websites, apps, prototypes, proof-of-concepts. Some of them will be spin-off and will generate income that will be reinvested. Because of our unique structure we believe majority of the projects will be related to the new models of governance and ownership.</p>

	<h3>Hospitality</h3>
	<p>Go to place for digital nomads, makers, researchers to work with likeminded individuals. Main benefit of working from the chapel: </p>

	<h3>Kickstarter <em>(Jan / Feb 2017)</em></h3>
	<p>We will use Kickstarter and Indiegogo. On top of receiving cash we would conduct <strong>Market Research</strong> - to establish if the idea has enough traction and we have enough power to promote the project!</p>

	<ul>
		<li>£1 postcard <em>(to get plenty of backers and boost visibility)</em></li>
		<li>£5 meal</li>
		<li>£25 one night stay</li>
		<li>£100 1:1 strategy session</li>
		<li>£500 day of engineering work (consultancy)</li>
	</ul>

	Needs more thinking and planning:
	<ul>
		<li>Memorable plaque</li>
		<li>Privilege to name each of the pillars supporting the gallery</li>
		<li>Design your own stained glass</li>
		<li>Much more sophisticated hospitality packages</li>
		<li>Sales of artworks created by supporting artists</li>
		<li>Perpetual memberships</li>
		<li>"build your own room"</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Company sponsorship</h3>


	<h3>Retreats</h3>
	<p>Chapel is a spacious venue and could host a whole company of up to 20 people. It could be eligible to rent for a specified number of days.</p>

	<h3>Equity crowdfunding</h3>
	<p>SEIS, <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/">https://www.seedrs.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/">https://www.crowdcube.com/</a> - hell yeah why not...</p>

	<h3>Council, Government, EU, Lottery Fund</h3>
	<p>They are rather slow to move and require a lot of paperwork. We may want to lay foundation ourselves, prove feasability and apply for larger grants later on.</p>

	<h3>Visionaires, Philanthropists</h3>
	<p>Not the typical investors expecting 100x returns, obsessed about the bottom line. HNWI <em>(High Net Worth Individual)</em> who believe in the mission and want support the project and offer their guidance.</p>

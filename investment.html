	<h3>Holding company</h3>
	<p>We intend to create a Social Enterprise holding company that owns the chapel and will also own a portion of equity in each spin-off company we create.</p>
	

	<h3>Kickstarter </h3>
	<p>We will use a crowdfunding platform to raise money for the project. In addition to extra funding, this will allow us to guage interest in our project and hopefully make waves some in cyberspace. Developing the campaign video will be one of our first <a href="voyages.html">voyages.</a></p>

	<p><strong>We're still working on the details of the campaign and exact reward structure</strong>, for now we've give an outline of what this might look like below and would love to hear your feedback. If you like what we're doing and are able to contribute some funds now, we love you. We'll promise you an early bird incentive and 1.5x your contribution when the campaign launches as a special thank you. The intention is to capitalise on traffic and early interest even before the Kickstarter is live.</p>

	<p><em>Note: At the moment we think we'll go with Kickstarter as the platform, it's not for profit and a lot of people are already signed up. Let us know if you have an opinion on this.</em></p>

	<p>Here are some rewards we're considering at the moment:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>1 postcard <em>(to get plenty of backers and boost visibility)</em></li>
		<li>Do we want such small reward? <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-1-Kickstarter-reward">https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-1-Kickstarter-reward</a></li>
		<li>£5 meal on the ship. Redeemable when the ship is not on a voyage.</li>
		<li>£30 membership of platform where you can sign up for voyages + 1 free night stay</li>
		<li>£100 one hour digital strategy session</li>
		<li>£300 the Astralship, yours to crew and command for 1 day</li>
		<li>£500 the Astralship 1days with Innovation Facilitation. 
		<li>£1500 the Astralship for 7 days</li>
		<li>£2500 the Astralship for 7 days with Innovation Facilitation</li>
		<li>~£5000 We'll assemble a custom crew using our team and selected specialists from our network to tackle your innovation challenge or develop your app or product. Get in touch.</li>
	</ul>

	Here are some random ideas thrown in, let's us know what you think of these:
	<ul>
		<li>A plaque built and installed on the good ship Astral</li>
		<li>Name each of the pillars supporting the upper gallery</li>
		<li>Design your own stained glass window</li>
		<li>"Design and build you own room on the ship"</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We have a number of other options for raising funds:</p>
	<h3>Borrowing</h3>
	<p>We are evaluating obtaining a commercial mortgage on the Chapel.</p>

	<h3>Our own cash</h3>
	<p>I have savings, you have savings, we can probably find a few other individuals interested in investing too.</p>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p>There are some other potential revenue streams in our business plan:</p>
	<h3>Spinout businesses</h3>
	<p>Once we have an Astralship we're keen to demonstrate what we can do with it. We'll create products, websites, apps, designs, and prototypes. From some of these voyages we'll create be spin-off companies and these will generate income for Astralship. We're very interested in using avant garde models of shared governance and ownership for these projects.</p>

	<h3>Hospitality</h3>
	<p>The ship could become a go to place for digital nomads, makers, and researchers looking to work independently or with likeminded individuals and achieve states of <a href="flow.html">flow</a> which staying in one of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37754756">most beautiful places</a> in the world</p>

	<h3>Company Hireout</h3>
	<p>We'll hire the whole ship out to corporate clients when we need income and aren't using the ship. Companies can use the ship from their own voyages (for which we'll offer facilitation), for training workshops or inducting new recruits</p>

	<h3>Retreats</h3>
	<p>The ship will be suitable as a retreat location for running residentual courses.</p>

	<h3>Equity crowdfunding</h3>
	<p>We're currently investigating SEIS, <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/">https://www.seedrs.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/">https://www.crowdcube.com/</a>. If you are an accountant, lawyer or any person skilled in navigating paperwork - please join us. We want to avoid costly mistakes on technicalities. We need you.</p>

	<h3>Council, Government, EU, Lottery Fund</h3>
	<p>These can be slow to move, constraining and require a lot of paperwork and management overhead. For now we probably want to lay the foundations of the project ourselves, prove feasability and apply for larger grants later on. We'll start by running independently using our own cash and the funds from the crowdfunding.</p>

	<h3>Visionaires, Philanthropists, Social Investors</h3>
	<p>We don't really want investors who are only interested in the bottom line. We are looking for individuals who believe in the mission and want support the project and participate in the adventure.</p>

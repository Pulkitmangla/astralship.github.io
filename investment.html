	<h3>Holding company</h3>
	<p>We intend that the "chapel" <em>(holding company that owns the chapel)</em> will own a portion of equity of each spin-off company - this is to incentivise investors and ensure long-term prosperity of the project.</p>

	<p>We believe that living and working in such an environment will foster innovation on unprecedented levels and our products will be used by people around the world.</p>
	

	<h3>Kickstarter </h3>
	<p>We will use a crowdfunding platform. The intention is to obtain extra cash, to conduct real-life <strong>market research</strong> and make waves in the cyberspace. It is also a test for us - do we have enough power to promote the project - of course we do but before we put our whole livehood on the line it's always reassuring to have some backing and support</p>

	Here are some rewards we were considering.

	<ul>
		<li>£1 postcard <em>(to get plenty of backers and boost visibility)</em></li>
		<li>£5 meal</li>
		<li>£25 one night stay</li>
		<li>£100 one hour digital strategy session</li>
		<li>£500 day of engineering work (consultancy)</li>
	</ul>

	Needs more thinking and planning:
	<ul>
		<li>Memorable plaque</li>
		<li>Privilege to name each of the pillars supporting the gallery</li>
		<li>Design your own stained glass</li>
		<li>Much more sophisticated hospitality packages</li>
		<li>Sales of artworks created by supporting artists</li>
		<li>Perpetual memberships</li>
		<li>"build your own room"</li>
		<li>Hire us for a journey...</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Own cash</h3>
	<p>I have savings, you have savings, we can probably find a few invested individuals too.</p>

	<h3>Sustainable business(es)</h3>
	<p>We will create a number of products, websites, apps, prototypes, proof-of-concepts. Some of them will be spin-off and will generate income that will be reinvested. Because of our unique structure we believe majority of the projects will be related to the new models of governance and ownership.</p>

	<h3>Hospitality</h3>
	<p>Go to place for digital nomads, makers, researchers to work with likeminded individuals. See <a href="peakperformance.html"> to see benefits of working from the chapel</p>

	<h3>Company sponsorship</h3>
	<p>TODO: company pays a certain amount and in exchange we offer days in the chappel and other related services.</p>

	<h3>Retreats</h3>
	<p>Chapel is a spacious venue and could host a whole company of up to 24 people. It could be eligible to rent for a specified number of days.</p>

	<h3>Equity crowdfunding</h3>
	<p>SEIS, <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/">https://www.seedrs.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/">https://www.crowdcube.com/</a> - hell yeah why not...</p>

	<h3>Council, Government, EU, Lottery Fund</h3>
	<p>They are rather slow to move and require a lot of paperwork. We may want to lay foundation ourselves, prove feasability and apply for larger grants later on. At this stage we prefer to run it the "pirate way" using own cash and money coming from crowdfunding.</p>

	<h3>Visionaires, Philanthropists</h3>
	<p>Not the typical investors expecting 100x returns, obsessed about the bottom line. HNWI <em>(High Net Worth Individual)</em> who believe in the mission and want support the project and want to participate in the adventure.</p>

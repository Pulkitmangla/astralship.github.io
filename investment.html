	<h3>Holding company</h3>
	<p>We intend to create a Social Enterprise holding company that owns the chapel and will also own a portion of equity in each spin-off company we create.</p>
	

	<h3>Kickstarter </h3>
	<p>We will use a crowdfunding platform to raise money for the project. In addition to extra funding, this will allow us to guage interest in our project and hopefully make waves some in cyberspace. Developing the campaign video will be one of our first <a href="voyages.html">voyages.</a></p>

	<p><strong>We're still working on the details of the campaign and exact reward structure</strong>, for now we've give an outline of what this might look like below and would love to hear your feedback. If you like what we're doing and are able to contribute some funds now, we love you. We'll promise you an early bird incentive and 1.5x your contribution when the campaign launches as a special thank you. The intention is to capitalise on traffic and early interest even before the Kickstarter is live.</p>

	<p><em>Note: At the moment we think we'll go with Kickstarter as the platform, it's not for profit and a lot of people are already signed up. Let us know if you have an opinion on this.</em></p>

	<p>Here are some rewards we're considering at the moment:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>1 postcard <em>(to get plenty of backers and boost visibility)</em></li>
		<li>Do we want such small reward? <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-1-Kickstarter-reward">https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-1-Kickstarter-reward</a></li>

		<li>£1500 the Astralship for 7 days</li>
		<li>£2500 the Astralship for 7 days with Innovation Facilitation</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Much longer hospitality packages <em>(weeks, months, years)</em></li>
		<li>Hire they chapel for a journey...</li>
		<li>Hire the crew a journey...</li>
	</ul>
	We are considering hiring our resources both in terms of the venue and manpower. See more about <a href="voyages.html">voyages</a>.


	Some random ideas thrown into space to see what sticks:
	<ul>
		<li>Memorable plaque</li>
		<li>Privilege to name each of the pillars supporting the upper gallery</li>
		<li>Design your own stained glass</li>
		<li>Sales of artworks created by supporting artists</li>
		<li>Perpetual memberships</li>
		<li>"build your own room"</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Borrowing</h3>
	<p>We are evaluating option of obtaining a mortgage.</p>

	<h3>Own cash</h3>
	<p>I have savings, you have savings, we can probably find a few invested individuals too.</p>

	<h3>Sustainable business(es)</h3>
	<p>Once we have a Astralship we will release plenty of energy to create a number of products, websites, apps, prototypes, proof-of-concepts. Some of them will be spin-off and will generate income that will be reinvested. Because of our unique structure we believe majority of the projects will be related to the new models of governance and ownership.</p>

	<h3>Hospitality</h3>
	<p>Go to place for digital nomads, makers, researchers to work with likeminded individuals. See <a href="flow.html">flow state</a> to see benefits of working from the chapel</p>

	<h3>Company sponsorship</h3>
	<p>TODO: company pays a certain amount and in exchange we offer days in the chapel and other related services.</p>

	<h3>Retreats</h3>
	<p>Chapel is a spacious venue and could host a whole company of up to 24 people. It could be eligible to rent for a specified number of days.</p>

	<h3>Equity crowdfunding</h3>
	<p>SEIS, <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/">https://www.seedrs.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/">https://www.crowdcube.com/</a> - open to such options... If you are an accountant, lawyer or any person skilled in navigating paperwork - please join us. We would much rather avoid costly mistakes on silly technicalities. We need you.</p>

	<h3>Council, Government, EU, Lottery Fund</h3>
	<p>They are rather slow to move and require a lot of paperwork. We may want to lay foundation ourselves, prove feasability and apply for larger grants later on. At this stage we prefer to run it the independently using own cash and money coming from crowdfunding.</p>

	<h3>Visionaires, Philanthropists</h3>
	<p>Not the typical investors expecting 100x returns, obsessed about the bottom line. We are looking for individuals who believe in the mission and want support the project and want to participate in the adventure.</p>

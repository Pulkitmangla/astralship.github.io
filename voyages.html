	<h3>This is how we sail</h3>
	
	<p>Once we have a ship we have many ideas for voyages we want to make. Our team won't control all the voyages, sometimes we'll sail ourselves, sometimes we'll plan voyages and recruits crew, and other times we'll simply hand over the ship for others to use. When we set the goals we'll seek to tackle some of the grand societal challenges facing us today. Think <a href="http://www.poc21.cc/">http://www.poc21.cc/</a> but on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>Voyages are suited to rapid prototyping of ideas and tackling innovation and design challenges. Sometime it could be an entrepreneur with funding wanting to develop their business idea and take it to market faster than any corporate environment will allow, where we make money like this we'll use it to offset the cost of other voyages which may have great social benefit but not their own funding</p>

<p>As time goes on we'll increasingly develop resources that aid teams in leveraging the results of their voyages. Teams are welcome to return to our ships for subsequent voyages as we carry on our missions.</p

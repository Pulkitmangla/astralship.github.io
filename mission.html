	<h3>Sustainability and Regenerative Ecosystems</h3>
	<p>We cannot keep the planet in the current state.</p>
	<p>What we do now is completely not sustainable.</p>
	<p>Humans have to change the way they are living on this planet and soon if we are to be around much longer.</p>

	<h3>Realising human potential</h3>
	<p>Peak performance, <a href="flow">flow state</a>, removing limiting beliefs and living life to the fullest.
	<p>We don't live in a vacuum. We interact with the surrounding ecosystem. We will enhance the space to guarantee proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, lighting, oxygen...</p>
	<p>We will also monitor our system - quantified self - to have real-time feedback and address issues immediately as they arise. An example would be - incresed heart rate and stress hormone - obligatory break and burning 200 calories.</p>

	<h3>Independent lifestyle</h3>
	<p>All to often regular employment provides just enough income to a rent a flat close enough to the office. Morning communite can be a draining experience. What if we change this model and provide everything we need, including income-earning ability? See <a href="investment.htmt">investestment</a> to see different revenue streams.</p>

	<h3>Sense of adventure</h3>
	<p>We are faciliating <a href="flow.html">flow states</a>, peak performance and doing the best work with talented, likeminded individuals. With such attitude we can achieve much more than companies operating in traditional environments.</p>
	<p>We envision that the chapel will attract the top talent. People who are incentivised to be in such environment. At first we are unable to pay commercial rates but we are experimenting with new models of ownership and governance and we are open to discuss equity ownership in the company for those who are really commited</p>

	<h3>Collaborative culture</h3>
	<p>We believe in open and collaborative culture.</p>
	<p>We always strive to use best available tools and technology for each project.</p>
	<p>We use Github, Slack, Trello, and Google Docs - we know that Google remains a controversial company but we will use their products as long as they serve us. If you happen to know better, more reliable, more approachable products - or if you want to create one - we are very receptive, we are more than happy to contribute. For now - we are working on the "building party" <em>(see <a href="https://astralship.eventbrite.co.uk">Eventbrite</a>)</em> and we don't have resources to create fully fledged collaboration platform from scratch.</p>

	<h3>Sustainability</h3>
	<p>We cannot keep the planet in the current state.</p>
	<p>What we do now is completely not sustainable.</p>
	<p>Humans have to change the way they are living on this planet and soon if we are to be around much longer.</p>
	<p>Keyword: <strong>Regenerative ecosystems</strong></p>

	<h3>Realising human potential</h3>
	<p>We don't live in a vacuum. We interact with the surrounding ecosystem. With the proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, lighting we can maximise our potential, live the life to the fullest.</p>

	<h3>Independent lifestyle</h3>
	<p>All to often regular employment provides just enough income to a rent a flat close enough to the office. Morning communite can be a draining experience. What if we change this model and provide everything we need, including income-earning ability? See <a href="investment.htmt">investestment</a> to see different revenue streams.</p>

	<h3>Sense of adventure</h3>
	<p>We are faciliating <a href="flow.html">flow states</a>, peak performance and doing the best work with talented, likeminded individuals. With such attitude we can achieve much more than companies operating in traditional environments.</p>

	<h3>Collaborative culture</h3>
	<p>We believe in open and collaborative culture.</p>
	<p>We always strive to use best available tools and technology for each project.</p>

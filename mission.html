<h3>Regenerating ecosystems and systematic change</h3>
<p>Planet Earth is not doing well - global warming is taking its toll <em>(see this <a href="https://xkcd.com/1732/">XKCD</a>)</em>. As individuals we can feel helpless, and for the informed there is often a crushing sense of hopelessness which is itself the cause of apathy. Technology itself will not lead us to sustainability, only our will to develop and utilise the available technology could change our trajectory.  </p>
<p>Revolutions in human behaviour have happened in the past. Today rich and powerful corporations cast spells of PR to control the masses into giving them more wealth and power. Fundamentally we are all human beings, living for a time on our planet. These spells can be broken. We are all human beings with the same basic needs. We all want to protect ourselves and those we love, but when we see the only way to protect those we love is to protect our species and planet we can start to build the world based on set of values.</p>
<p>In the old paradigm, the priority is the profit for shareholders. We take into account people and the planet, and we always implement solutions in a way that everyone wins.</p>


<h3>The Adventurification of Innovation</h3>
<p>Astralship believes in the possibility of a radical transformation in human behaviour and economy.</p>
<p>There are many projects and people working around the globe who connect with the same vision. We bring together visionaries to co-create in shared physical and virtual spaces. We bring together the brightest and the best. Those who will sail together to achieve goals of the <a href="voyages.html">voyage</a>.</p>


<h3>Purism vs Pragmatism</h3>
<p>While we all have unlimited human creative potential, we don’t have unlimited resources at hand. To achieve our goals we need to engage with the current economic paradigm and at times this may include hiring out the ship (see our <a href="investment.html">inverstment strategy</a>). We’ll never hire it out if we feel it’s taking us further away from our goal and we will always prioritise our mission, but we will make balanced pragmatic decision on how we get there and that will include making money. It’s easy to be a purist disconnected from reality, it take bravery and integrity to bring a pure vision and manifest it into something real.</p>

	
<h3>Realising human potential (<a href="flow.html">flow</a>)</h3>
<p>We know that what most of us achieve in our daily lives is far from our potential. We are building a space that is devoted to Peak performance, we will achieve it through art, though facilitation, smart environments and psychology such as enabling the <a href="flow">flow state</a>. We build a magical space with a creative intensity that removes limiting beliefs. We gives our crews a own ship and the ability and freedom to sail to anywhere. Together we’ll to sail to a new reality. Incredible energy and creativity, channeled and grounded to create real world solutions. </p>


<h3>Independent pirate lifestyle</h3>
<p>All too often regular employment provides just enough income to a rent a flat close enough to the office. Morning commutes to work with in a job where the primary motivation is often keeping the boss happy who’s job is to keep the shareholders happy. This soul destroying routines that are taken as inevitable. We work and then go home to try and forget and spend them money we earn trying to make life bearable. </p>


<p>Astralship is about changing this model. We’ll start with one ship but want to create a global network. Talented individuals usually know what they’re worth and the commercial market, they know where they really add value. Astralship allow individuals to come and work at <a href="flow.html">peak-performance</a> where they can add maximum value in collaboration with others. For example good software developer should comfortably be able to earn all the money they need in a year from 6 productive 2 week voyages. The rest of the time? Live how you want to live and enjoy being on this planet for the limited time you have. When we have more time on our hands and are freed up from the limiting belief about what we should be doing, we quickly realise that the best things in life are free. </p>


<h3>Collaborative culture</h3>
<p>We believe in open and collaborative culture.</p>
<p>We always strive to use best available tools and technology for each project.</p>
<p>We use Github, Slack, Trello, and Google Docs - we know that Google is controversial but we will use their products as long as they serve us. If you happen to know better, more reliable, more approachable products - or if you want to create one - we are very receptive to new technologies and ideas, we are happy to adapt and contribute. </p>

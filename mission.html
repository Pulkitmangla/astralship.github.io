	<h3>The challenge of sustainability and Regenerating Ecosystems</h3>
	<p>Our Planet is dying. As individuals we can feel powerless to influence the trajectory we are on, and for the informed there is often a crushing sense of hopelessness which is itself the greatest cause of apathy. Technology itself will not lead us to sustainability, only our will to develop and utilise the available technology and break free from apathy. </p>

<p>Revolutions in human behaviour have happened in the past. Today rich and powerful corporations cast spells of PR to control the masses into giving them more wealth and power. Fundamentally we are all human beings, living for a time on our planet. These spells can be broken. We are all human beings with the same basic needs. We all want to protect ourselves and those we love, but when we see the only way to protect those we love is to protect our species and planet we can start to build a new world and revivify our dying planet.  </p>

<p>Currently, our global culture celebrates entrepreneurs as the greatest of our species. While there are some who are helping develop a viable future, there are also many whose only contribution is to generate wealth by taking us faster into the abyss and should really be ashamed of it. Future generations will not well remember those that squandered their talents for personal gain and egoism.</p>


<h3>The Adventurification of Innovation</h3>

<p>Astralship believes in the possibility of a radical transformation in human behaviour and economy. We are fully committed to realising it. We see our lives as a story, and as the hour grows darker we know it’s time for story, our adventure, to unfold. We see the maelstrom ahead and intend to sail directly into it, eyes open. </p>

<p>There are many projects and people working around the globe who connect with the same vision. Astralship is about intensity. We bring together visionaries to co-create in shared physical and virtual spaces. We bring together the brightest and the best. Those who will sail together to achieve goals of the voyage. Those who will sailing because they are the only ones who can realise the voyage and discover a new world</p>

<h3>Purism vs Pragmatism</h3>

<p>While we all have unlimited human creative potential. We don’t have unlimited resources at hand. To achieve our goals we need to engage with the current economic paradigm and at times this may include hiring out the ship either manned or unmanned. We’ll never hire it out if we feel it’s taking us further away from our goal and we will always prioritise our mission, but we will make balanced pragmatic decision on how we get there and that will include making money. It’s easy to be a purist disconnected from reality, it take bravery and integrity to bring a pure vision and manifest it into something real.</p>

	
	<h3>Realising human potential</h3>
	<p>We know that what most of us achieve in our daily lives is far from our potential. We are building a space that is devoted to Peak performance, we will achieve it through art, though facilitation, smart environments and psychology such as enabling the <a href="flow">flow state</a>. We build a magical space with a creative intensity that removes limiting beliefs. We gives our crews a own ship and the ability and freedom to sail to anywhere. Together we’ll to sail to a new reality. Incredible energy and creativity, channeled and grounded to create real world solutions. </p>

<h3>Independent lifestyles; free as Pirates</h3>
	<p>All to often regular employment provides just enough income to a rent a flat close enough to the office. Morning commutes to work with in a job where the primary motivation is often keeping the boss happy who’s job is to keep the shareholders happy. This soul destroying routines that taken as inevitable. We work and then go home to try and forget and spend them money we earn trying to make life bearable. </p>

<p>Astralship is about changing this model. We’ll start with one ship but want to create a global network. Talented individuals usually know what they’re worth and the commercial market, they know where they really add value. Astralship allow individuals to come and work at peak-performance where they can add maximum value in collaboration with others. For example good software developer should comfortably be able to earn all the money they need in a year from 6 productive 2 week voyages. The rest of the time? Live how you want to live and enjoy being on this planet for the limited time you have. When we have more time on our hands and are freed up from the limiting belief about what we should be doing, we quickly realise that the best things in life are free. </p>

<h3>Collaborative culture</h3>
<p>We believe in open and collaborative culture.</p>
	<p>We always strive to use best available tools and technology for each project.</p>
	<p>We use Github, Slack, Trello, and Google Docs - we know that Google is controversial but we will use their products as long as they serve us. If you happen to know better, more reliable, more approachable products - or if you want to create one - we are very receptive to new technologies and ideas, we are happy to adapt, trial, and contribute. </p>

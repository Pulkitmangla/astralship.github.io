	<h3>Sustainability</h3>
	<p>We cannot keep the planet in the current state</p>
	<p>Currently planet is completely is not sustainable</p>
	<p><strong>Regenerative ecosystems</strong></p>


	<h3>Human potential</h3>
	<p>We don't live in a vacuum. We interact with the surrounding ecosystem. With the proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, lighting we can maximise our potential, live the life to the fullest.</p>


	<h3>Independent lifestyle</h3>
	<p>All to often regular employment provides just enough income to a rent a flat close enough to the office. Morning communite can be a draining experience. What if we change this model and provide everything we need, including income-earning ability? See <a href="investment.htmt">investestment</a> to see different revenue streams.</p>

	<h3>The next event will be announced here</h3>

	<p>For our launch event we used Eventbrite and Facebook. We are not big fans of Facebook but we did it anyway... For the next event we will be launching our own membership platform. Because software development takes longer than expected - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law">Hofstadter's_law</a> - so here is a temporary email signup... Once we are done with development you'll be very first to get onboard.</p>

	<p>We know it is not ideal - we have limited resources and we need to prioritise ruthlessly. If you have any questions - see <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> or <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> directly... We are on the <a href="mission.html">mission</a>, we are here to stay and your support is always greatly appreciated.</p>

	<h3>This is the place where we will inform about our future events</h3>

	<p>The initial event was a success - we gathered initial supporters - we found commited people - we managed to get done many things on budget and on schedule. We intent to run regular events as a way of earning social capital and gathering momentum. Having a clear deadline and knowing that people are counting on us - it enforces some motivational pressure and we are ready for it...</p>
